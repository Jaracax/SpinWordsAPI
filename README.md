The SpinWords API takes an input and reverse each individual word if said word has five or more characters.

## Development
The roadmap for this project will consist in:
+ Tracking it with Git
+ Adding the base java logic for reversing the words
+ Make use of the SpringBoot annotations to make it a RESTful service
+ Refine the java logic to make the project more precise and with more functionalities
+ Make use of a database

## Purpose of this project

+ To showcase my knowledge and abilities in different technologies such as:
    + Java
    - SpringBoot
    + Git
